Homebrew-cw
===========
These formulae provide software that are not (yet?) included into official mxcl/homebrew.

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap renard/cw` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can `brew install renard/cw/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.github.com/renard/homebrew-cw/master/<formula>.rb
```

How do I remove this tap?
-------------------------
Just `brew untap renard/cw`.
